abstract = "The Quick Response (QR) code was designed for storage information and high speed reading applications. In this paper, we present a new rich QR code, that has two storage levels and can be used for document authentication. This new rich QR code, named two level QR code (2LQR), has public and private storage levels. The public level is the same as the standard QR code storage level, therefore it is readable by any classical QR code application. The private level is constructed by replacing the black modules by specific textured patterns. It consists of information encoded using q-ary code with an error correction capacity. This allows us not only to increase the storage capacity of the QR code, but also to distinguish the original document from a copy. This authentication is due to the sensitivity of the used patterns to the Print-and-Scan (P&S) process. The pattern recognition method that we use to read the second level information, can be used both in a private message sharing and in an authentication scenario. It is based on maximizing the correlation values between P&S degraded patterns and reference patterns. The storage capacity can be significantly improved by increasing the code alphabet q or by increasing the textured pattern size. The experimental results show a perfect restoration of private information. It also highlights the possibility of using this new rich QR code for document authentication."
