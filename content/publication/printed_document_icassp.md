abstract = "The availability of high quality copy machines provides a large amount of printed document counterfeits. Numerous authentication techniques based on security printing, graphical codes, hashing or local hashing have been suggested earlier. In this paper, we propose a novel printed document authentication system based on sensitivity of a new two level QR (2LQR) code to copying process. This 2LQR code contains specific textured patterns, which are sensitive to printing and copying processes. Therefore, it can be used to detect unauthorized document duplication. Experimental results show the efficiency of this 2LQR code for copy detection."
