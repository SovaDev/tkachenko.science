abstract = "An invisible flow watermarking QIM scheme based on linear errorcorrecting subcodes for channels with substitution and deletion errors is proposed in this paper. The evaluation of scheme demonstrates similar to known scheme performance but with lower complexity as soon as its implementation is mainly based on linear decoding operations."
