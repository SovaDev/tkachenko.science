abstract = "Verification of a document legitimacy is a current important problem. In this paper we propose to use a textured image containing a visual message, which can be used for identification of differences between printed legitimate document and printed fake document. The suggested textured image consists of specific patterns which should satisfy particular conditions in order to give good recognition results after Print-and-Scan (P&S) process. The identification of a legitimate document is possible by correlating the patterns of the textured image with either the original patterns or representative P&S process patterns. Several experimental results validate the proposed verification method."
