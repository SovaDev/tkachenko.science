In today's world securing different data is very important to protect copyright and verify authenticity. The nowadays challenges are the detection of fake invoices, bank checks, diplomas, tax forms and other valuable documents. 
Due to development and availability of printing and scanning devices, the number of forged/counterfeited valuable documents and product packages is increasing. 
Therefore, different security elements have been suggested to prevent these illegal actions. The security elements differ by their production complexity, protection level and verification process. 
For example, the production process of paper watermarks is difficult and time-consuming, but it can be checked by the naked eyes. 
In the same time the copy sensitive graphical codes, introduced recently, have easy and simple generation process, but the verification can be done only by specialist with high resolution scanning device. 
Finally, the verification of security paper can be performed only by professionals in laboratories.

The graphical codes sensitive to coping process are very popular in product authentication domain, thanks to its easy creation, cheap production, significantly simple verification and high authentication performance. 
Therefore, several companies look for novel copy sensitive graphical codes in order to fill a gap in the market.
